# GlobalHack

Our entry for [GlobalHack VI](https://globalhack.org/globalhack-vi/).

Homelessness is a global problem begging for a solution. And while there are many factors that contribute to homelessness — poverty, education, race, and mental health — we know that without better-coordinated services for homeless citizens, it’s difficult for us to make a difference. GlobalHack VI will work to solve this issue, by challenging teams to create software that helps agencies like the St. Patrick Center and other service providers better answer the question – how can we do more with less?

### The problem

Different homelessness support shelters have various entry requirements and focuses. Some are women-only, some are family-only, some cater to vets, some specialize in those with STIs, etc. These requirements can be confusing and frustrating to navigate.

### The project

Many homeless people [have smartphones](https://pressroom.usc.edu/homeless-teens-consider-smart-phone-as-important-as-food/). This makes a user-facing app a viable solution to the problem.

This web app allows users to enter some personal information, and find shelters with capacity that they are eligible to visit. Furthermore, if a shelter is at capacity, the an administrator can refer that person to another shelter with a better chance of receiving support.
